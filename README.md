# BMI Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Python's `Tkinter` library. The application allows users to input their weight and height, calculates their BMI, and classifies it into categories such as "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," or "Obesity."

## Features
- User-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with `Tkinter`.
- Input fields for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Displays the calculated BMI and provides classification.
- Handles errors for invalid input (e.g., negative values or non-numeric inputs).
- Stores and prints historical BMI data for demonstration.
  
## How to Use
1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberfortify/bmi-calculator.git
   cd bmi-calculator
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python bmi_calculator.py
   ```
4. Enter your weight and height in the appropriate fields, then click on the "Calculate BMI" button. The application will display your BMI and classification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `Tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python for most systems)

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional units (e.g., pounds and inches) with automatic conversion to metric.
- Implement historical data storage and visualization (e.g., graphs showing BMI trends).
- Create a more detailed report based on the BMI classification, providing health tips.
